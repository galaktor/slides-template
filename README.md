This is a little template for making slides using open, text-based technologies - namely HTML, Javascript and CSS. You can edit it in any text editor and run the presentation in any modern browser, on any platform that can run bespoke browser.

It uses an open-source framework called [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). There you can find extensive [documentation](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki) and some nifty [examples](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) of what it can do.

This version is a minimal example and was modified to have a simple banner at the bottom.

Here's what the template looks like - you'll have to customize it to your needs, it only shows a few basic things you can do.
